code i have practiced and build


Hello, and welcome to my GitHub.

I am a self-taught, entry-level AI programmer with a strong focus on Python and a growing interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I began my programming journey through independent study, hands-on experimentation, and building small projects to better understand how data, algorithms, and models work in real-world applications.

My current learning path includes:

-Python programming fundamentals

-Introductory machine learning concepts

-Working with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas,  and TensorFlow (learning stage)

I approach AI development with curiosity, discipline, and a problem-solving mindset. While I am at the beginning of my professional AI career, I am committed to continuous learning, writing clean and understandable code, and improving through practice and feedback.

This GitHub contains learning projects, experiments, and practice work that reflect my progress and understanding as I grow in the field of AI and software development. I value transparency in my learning process and welcome constructive feedback and collaboration.

My goal is to build a solid foundation in AI and Python development and eventually contribute to meaningful, real-world projects.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
